# My Home Library – Full Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
Ready to copy-paste straight into Replit Agent

### 1. Product Goal
A beautiful, mobile-first personal home library where anyone can scan a book barcode with their phone → instantly see the cover and details → and drop it onto one of their virtual “bookcases.” Zero typing, works offline after first load, feels magical.

### 2. Target Users & Pain Point
- Book lovers who own 50–5000 physical books  
- Tired of spreadsheets or clunky apps that require manual entry  
- Want to see their actual shelves digitally and know “where is my copy of Dune?”

### 3. Core User Stories (MVP – must be in v1)
1. As a user, I open the app on my phone and immediately see “Scan a book” button.  
2. As a user, I tap Scan → use camera → barcode is detected → book info + cover appears in <2 sec.  
3. As a user, I tap “Add to shelf” → choose or create a bookcase (e.g., “Kids Room”, “Office Oak”) → book is saved forever.  
4. As a user, I can open any bookcase and see a gorgeous responsive grid of covers (like Netflix).  
5. As a user, I can tap any cover to see full details + edit shelf location or add personal notes.  
6. As a user, the app works 100 % offline after the first visit (PWA + IndexedDB).

### 4. Stretch / Nice-to-Have (v2 – can be added later)
- Search & filter  
- Wishlist shelf  
- Dark mode toggle  
- Export / backup to JSON  
- Manual entry fallback  
- Multiple users / family sharing

### 5. Tech Stack (Replit-perfect, zero config)
- Frontend: HTML + Tailwind CSS + Vanilla JS (or React if Agent prefers – both fine)  
- Barcode scanning: Quagga2 or ZXing JS library (camera → instant)  
- Book data: Google Books API (free, no key needed for ISBN lookup)  
  → https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:9780140328721  
- Storage: IndexedDB via idb library (offline-first)  
- Hosting: Replit one-click deploy + custom domain ready  
- PWA: Manifest + service worker so it installs on phone home screen
